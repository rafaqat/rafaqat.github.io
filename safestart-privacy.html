<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>SafeStart</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application and related services (the "Service"). SafeStart is a workplace safety learning management system that provides training courses, assessments, and certification.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>When your organization registers you for SafeStart, we collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name (first and last)</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Employee or national identification number (as provided by your employer)</li>
    <li>Organization/tenant affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning Activity Data</h3>
<p>As you use SafeStart, we automatically collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Course enrollment and completion records</li>
    <li>Assessment scores and responses</li>
    <li>Video lesson progress and completion timestamps</li>
    <li>Certificates earned and their verification codes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proctoring Data</h3>
<p>When you take proctored assessments, SafeStart may access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Camera feed (for identity verification and session monitoring)</li>
    <li>Microphone input (for environment monitoring during assessments)</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Camera and microphone access is only activated during proctored assessment sessions with your explicit permission. You will be prompted to grant access each time, and you can deny it (though this may prevent you from completing proctored assessments).
</div>

<h3>Device and Technical Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens (stored securely in your device's Keychain)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use your information to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Authenticate your identity and manage your account</li>
    <li>Deliver training courses and assessments assigned by your organization</li>
    <li>Track your learning progress and generate completion certificates</li>
    <li>Conduct proctored assessments to ensure assessment integrity</li>
    <li>Provide your organization with training compliance reports</li>
    <li>Send push notifications about course assignments and deadlines</li>
    <li>Improve the Service and develop new features</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
<p>We share your information only in these circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>With your employer/organization:</strong> Your learning progress, assessment scores, certificates, and proctoring session results are shared with the organization that enrolled you in SafeStart.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate verification:</strong> When a certificate is verified using its public verification code, the certificate holder's name, course name, and certificate status are displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use third-party services for AI-generated training content (video, audio, images). These providers process content on our behalf and do not receive your personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information when required by law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Authentication tokens are stored in your device's secure Keychain, not in plain text.</li>
    <li>All communication between the app and our servers uses HTTPS encryption.</li>
    <li>Server data is hosted on secure infrastructure with access controls.</li>
    <li>Each organization's data is isolated through multi-tenant architecture, preventing cross-organization data access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your data for as long as your organization maintains an active account with SafeStart. Learning records and certificates may be retained longer to support ongoing certification verification. When your organization's account is terminated, your personal data will be deleted within 90 days, unless retention is required by law.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your personal data</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing of your data</li>
    <li>Receive your data in a portable format</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise these rights, contact your organization's administrator or reach out to us at the contact information below.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>SafeStart is designed for workplace use and is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes through the app or by other means. Your continued use of SafeStart after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
